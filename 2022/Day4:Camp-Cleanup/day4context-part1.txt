PUZZLE INPUT: 
Represents sections of the camp that pairs of Elves have been assigned to tidy up.
Each line represents sections that one pair of elves have been assigned.
These are referred to as 'assignment pairs'

The line:
2-8,3-7
represents one Elf getting sections: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, while another elf in the pair gets 
sections: 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7


GOAL:
Find how many 'assignment pairs' have a situation where one range fully contains another
range.


EXAMPLE:
Given a line: 
2-8,3-7

The first Elf has been assigned sections 2-8, that is, sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
and 8

The second Elf has been assigned sections 3-7, that is, sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7

These sections are considered to overlap. Furthermore, the second Elf's sections
are 'fully contained' inside the sections of the first Elf. That is to say, 
the second Elf's sections are all completely overlapping with the first Elf's
sections.

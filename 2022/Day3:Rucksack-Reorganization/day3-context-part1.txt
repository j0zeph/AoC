PUZZLE INPUT: 
Represents bags/rucksacks with items in them. I will use the term 'bag' henceforth.
Each line in the input represents items in one bag. 
A bag has two compartments, each holding the same number of items.

An item is represented by a single character. Items `a` and `A` are considered
unique items.

The first half of letters in a line represent items in the first compartment, while
the second half of letters represent items in the second compartment of the bag.

Every item also has a priority, to help prioritize arrangement.
Letters a - z have priority 1 - 26
Letters A - Z have priority 27 - 52


EXAMPLE:
Given a line: cwvbHHbCqVchRDHgDsPTdt

Items in first compartment are: cwvbHHbCqVc
Items in second compartment are: hRDHgDsPTdt
The item common to both compartments is: H 

The priority of that common item `H` is 34

Therefore, the total of the priority of the common item in that line is
34


GOAL:
Find the sum of the priorities of the common items in both compartments of all
given bags in the input.

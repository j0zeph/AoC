PUZZLE INPUT: 
First column represents moves (A=rock, B=paper, C=scissors) played by my opponent.
Second column represents the outcome of the game: whether I should 
lose, draw or win the round (X=lose, Y=draw, Z=win)
Each 'round' of the game is a row in the input file.


SCORING:
Each shape has a score according to the guide below: 
Rock: 1
Paper: 2
Scissors: 3

From my POV, a win, loss, or draw is scored like this:
Win: 6
Draw: 3 
Loss: 0

My total score for a round is the score of the shape I chose (rock, paper, scissors), 
plus the score of the outcome of a round (win, lost, drew)


GOAL:
Find the total score that I would get if I made moves against my opponent, 
according to the puzzle input, with the new instructions

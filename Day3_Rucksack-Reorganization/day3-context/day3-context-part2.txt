PUZZLE INPUT: 
Every set of 3 lines in the input represents items in bags that are 
carried by one group of elves.

Every elf in that group carries a badge, which represents an item that `all` three
elves in that group are carrying in their bags.
That badge is also referred to as the group's 'badge item type'

Items are still represented by a single character. Items `a` and `A` are considered
unique items.

Every item also has a priority, to help prioritize arrangement.
Letters a - z have priority 1 - 26
Letters A - Z have priority 27 - 52



GOAL:

Find the sum of priorities of all 'badge item types' for all the groups of elves.



EXAMPLE:

Given three lines: 
vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg

The item that is common to all three bags carried by the elves in this group is `r`

Given three other lines: 
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw

The item that is common to all three bags carried by the elves in this group is `Z`

Therefore, the total of the priorities of the common items from both groups is
18(r) + 52(Z) = 70

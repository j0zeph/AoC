PUZZLE INPUT: 
A) The first few lines are a representation of the initial arrangement of crates
on stacks.

The lines below show 3 stacks of crates: 

    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 

B) The next few lines of the input represent the moves that need to be made, in
order to take a crate from one stack to another

This time round, crates will not be moved 1 by 1, but rather all in one go.



GOAL:
Find the top crates from all stacks after all the moves in the input are made.



EXAMPLE: 
Given the following lines:
move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 1 from 2 to 1

The first line says to move 1 crate, from the top, from stack 2 to stack 1.
The crate arrangement after that move is:

[D]        
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

The second line says to move 3 crates (in one go, without re-arranging), from stack 1 
to stack 2.
The crate arrangement after that move is:

        [Z]
        [N]
    [C] [D]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3

The third line says to move 1 crate , from stack 2 to stack 1.
The crate arrangement after that move is:

        [Z]
        [N]
        [D]
[C] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

The top-most crates for the final arrangement of stacks are therefore:

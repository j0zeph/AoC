PUZZLE INPUT: 
Represents a signal (which is a stream of characters) being emiited from the Elves'
malfunctioning communications device, which needs to be processed.

A sequence of fourteen characters--in which there is no repeated letter--in the signal 
is called a `message`

The `start-of-message marker` is the character in the signal that is immediately after 
the last character of a message.



GOAL:
Find how many characters in the signal need to be processed before the first
`start-of-message marker` is detected.



EXAMPLE: 
Given the short data-streams below:
mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb
zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw

For the first stream, the `start-of-message marker` is after character 19.
Therefore 19 is the output.

For the second stream, the `start-of-message marker` is after character 26.
Therefore 26 is the output.

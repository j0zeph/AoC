PUZZLE INPUT: 
Represents a signal (which is a stream of characters) being emiited from the Elves'
malfunctioning communications device, which needs to be processed.

A sequence of four characters--in which there is no repeated letter--in the signal 
is called a `packet`

The `start-of-packet marker` is the character in the signal that is immediately after 
the last character of a packet.


GOAL:
Find how many characters in the signal need to be processed before the first
`start-of-packet marker` is detected.


EXAMPLE: 
Given the short data-stream below:
bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz

The first 4 characters are: 'bvwb', which have a repeated 'b', so this does not count as a packet.

The next 4 characters in the stream are: 'vwbj' (not 'jplb', because the next characters are found
using a 'sliding window' motion).
In the characters 'vwbj', there is no repeated letter, so this counts as a packet.

After the last 'j' in the 'vwbj' packet, is the letter 'p'. This 'p' considered
the `start-of-packet marker`.

Hovewer, before we reached that letter 'p', the letters 'bvwbj' (5 letters) had to be
processed. 

Therefore, 5 is the output.
